# 🌦️ Weather App

## 🎯 Objective
To build a responsive and user-friendly weather forecasting application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions of any city using a public API.

---

## 📄 Project Description
This Weather App is a single-page application (SPA) built with **React.js** and **Vite**. The goal was to learn API integration, React component structure, and dynamic UI updates based on external data. The app fetches live weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays key weather information including:

- 🌡️ Temperature  
- 💧 Humidity  
- 🌥️ Weather condition  
- 🌬️ Wind speed

🧠 Challenges Faced
-🔐 API Key Security
Initially pushed .env with a real key — quickly revoked the key and updated .gitignore to prevent this again.

-📱 Responsive Design
Adjusted layout for better viewing across different screen sizes.

-❌ Error Handling
Handled cases like invalid city names and missing API responses.
